<p style="text-align:justify">I am an Assistant Professor for Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a> (NYU-CSE). I am a member of VIDA, the Visualization, Imaging and Data Analysis Center at NYU Tandon and the Permutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone. Before my professor position, I was a postdoc research fellow and subgroup leader at <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">VCG Harvard</a>, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> and a senior research scientist at the <a href="https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/" target="_blank">Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School</a>. I received my Ph.D. degree (Dr. rer. nat.) in Computer Science at the Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems, University of Stuttgart in 2017. My <a href="https://kruegert.github.io/portfolio/">research</a> interests lie in the field of data visualization and visual analytics for on spatial and spatially-referenced multivariate data with a focus on biomedical visualization to understand diseases, most notably cancer.<br/><br/></p>
